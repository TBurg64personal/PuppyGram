### Pictures
For pictures you will need to drag and drop them into the phone emulator for them to be found in the files. Note: Currently the pictures need to be png not jpeg. Also the naming format for them must img1.png, img2.png, etc...

### Needs
Need to give permission to the emulator to have access to the phones photos. You can do this by exiting the app and opening the app settings and allowing the app to access all media files
